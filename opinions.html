            <h2 id="title">Facing the uncomfortable for true 'liberation'.</h2>
            <img class="pic" src="res/opinions/liberation.jpg" alt=""/>
            <p>"Jason, you should really step out of your comfort zone." This quote used to make me want to go jump out of a window. Why would I want to expose myself to discomfort and be reminded of my shortcomings? However, it turns out that there is an absolutely convincing reason why everybody should be trying to do just that.</p>
            <p>Both you and I have aspirations. Those dreams come true at times but not always because of our relationships with unpleasant sensations. Let's consider a smoker who wants to quit smoking but is unable to do so. Why can't he just stop? It's because every time the smoker is hit with the unpleasant feelings of withdrawal, his habitual response is avoiding the uncomfortable by smoking another cigarette. Will he be satisfied for an hour? Yes. Will he be satisfied in the long run? No. Because the smoker, and to some extent you and I, copes with pain by trying to hastily escape from it, his cannot live his life to its fullest potential.</p>
            <p>Leaving the depressing things behind, there is a good news: We have the ability to choose how to react to our feelings and personal setbacks. Science says human beings get better at and used to things they repeatedly do. If you play basketball everyday for 3 years, you will become fantastic at basketball. If you try saying, "Hi!" to a stranger for the first time, it will seem very awkward and difficult. However, if you repeat the process 300 times, you probably won't feel anything saying "Hi!" to anybody in the world. </p>
            <p>Extending this logic, if we develop a habit of not running away from uncomfortable experiences and instead embracing them in welcome, we'll find ourselves being able to live our lives so much fuller than what we previously thought was possible. By thinking about distasteful sensations as opportunities to make life more satisfying rather than horrible things to be avoided, we will react much calmer to negative experiences that will inevitably occur in life and in turn be liberated from the chains of our unhelpful compulsions.</p>

            <h2 id="title">Do we have a purpose?</h2>
            <img class="pic" src="res/opinions/purpose.jpg" alt=""/>
            <p>Purpose is a subjective concept. The purpose of an object or a being depends solely on the eyes of the thinker. For example, to many people the purpose of a Staples paper clip is to hold sheets of paper together. However, to a burglar in Texas the purpose of the same Staples paper clip may be opening locks. The point is that nothing in this world would have a purpose without conscious being(s) thinking about it.</p>
            <p>This analogy works just as well for your life and my life, but with an extra variable: The existence of god. If god does not exist, our lives would have no 'natural' purpose since the Big Bang didn't consciously intend to create human beings – we just happened to exist after a long succession of events. On the other hand, if god does exist and has been planning us to be at this place, in this moment, and living these exact lives, one can say that everyone has an ultimate purpose.</p>
            <p>Upon thinking about this idea, another question popped up in my mind – what are the implications? Does having an ultimate purpose in life matter? Practically speaking, I believe that the implications for the above scenarios are not much different. Having a purpose is often associated with motivation. People say, "My purpose in life is to be _______!". The word "purposeless" has a empty, depressing connotation. Yet, whether god exists or not, one has the potential to live a wonderfully happy life or an utterly miserable life. In terms of our 'destiny', the possession of purpose does not hold any significant meaning since it does not affect the future events in any way.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, whether each of us has an ultimate purpose in life would boil down to whether a higher being exists and whether it intended you or me to live in a specific way. Regardless of the truth, it would be best for us to direct our focus on the positive aspects of life like love, gratitude, and passion to be the happiest selves we can be.</p>

            <h2 id="title">Netflix, video games, YouTube – Are they bad by nature?</h2>
            <img class="pic" src="res/opinions/netflix.jpg" alt=""/>
            <p>One quality that Netflix, video games, and YouTube has in common is their time-wasting potential. Most of us are familiar (more than we'd like at times) with telling ourselves, "I'll take a break for 15 minutes," and discovering 8 hours later that there's only 30 minutes left to study for _______ exam. This phenomenon led a lot of students and unsurprisingly, most parents to develop a strongly negative opinions on "time wasters" of the internet era.</p>
            <p>Now, I'm not advocating that you should finish the entire season of "The Office" in 24hrs after reading this article. However, I do think it is important to acknowledge that there is nothing inherently wrong or harmful about these activities. The problem only arises when the relationship between a person and these activities begins to inhibit the person's ability to live a satisfying life.</p>
            <p>I'll use video game as an example. Some would think that a person is immature if he or she plays video games after the age of 22. The reasoning is intuitive: If you're still playing games at that age, you probably don't have hobbies and instead have a crippling self-control issue. However, consider the following fact: Elon Musk, one of the most successful enterpreneurs, occasionally <a id="link" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/739594006762393600?lang=en" target="_blank">plays and even recommends Overwatch</a> (a popular first person shooting game). Elon Musk is living an amazing life while playing video games, and this is possible only because his relationship with video games isn't a destructive one. The same logic applies to TV shows and YouTube.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, going on Netflix, playing video games, and watching YouTube videos once in a while is absolutely harmless in my opinion. It's not like these activities are physically addictive like caffeine and cocaine. One should simply be wary of forming psychological depedency, and if so, re-evaluate whether he or she really wants to sustain that lifestyle.</p>

            <h2 id="title">Is it possible to stay motivated without stress?</h2>
            <img class="pic" src="res/opinions/motivation.jpg" alt=""/>
            <p>As a guideline, if doing something makes you feel fulfilled, you will be motivated to do the same thing next time. Here's my straightforward hypothesis on: Staying motivated without being too stressed.</p>
            <p>
            1. To feel good, one must increase satisfaction and decrease disappointment after doing the activity.<br/>
            2. Both of these can be achieved by relenting expectations and accepting/forgiving one's failures to meet those expectations.<br/>
            3. To be able to do this, one must do his or her best to unconditionally accept the outcome of his or her past events.</p>
            <p>Here's a thought experiment to illustrate the point. Lets say Jason wanted to become good at playing baseball. One day, he decides to try batting for the first time with the expectation that he will hit 20 of the 100 balls that are thrown at him. He manages to hits 1 ball.</p>
            <p>Jason thinks to himself, "wow, I suck!" and his motivation to continue baseball decreases. He may or may not try playing baseball again but his brain registers the day's events as unpleasant.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, if Jason went to bat thinking, 'I will accept the outcome regardless of what it is. If I do well, great! If I hit 1 out of 100 balls, it's all good. Everyone starts from somewhere and I can't change the future,' he would feel much better about his outcome. It would be up to him whether he wants to play baseball more or not after discovering his natural ineptness for the sport, but he would at least walk away unstressed compared to the alternative.</p>
            <p>There are many psychology studies on the effect of willingness on self-control. Perhaps our traditional assumptions about having to beat ourselves up for improvement can be re-examined and, possibly, be replaced.</p>
